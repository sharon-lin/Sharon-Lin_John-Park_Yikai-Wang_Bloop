Team Name: Musical Ensemble

Abstract: Our team is developing a GUI in which users will be able to operate and play a set of virtual drums. This can be useful for teaching beginners on how to operate a drum.

Description of Use: Users will hit virtual drums, allowing them to play melodies depending on what drums they hit. Different sounds/types of drums can be chosen. In addition, users will be able to save their melodies as files and upload melodies to be played.

Description of Design: We plan on using memory allocation, files (uploading), processes (forking, exec, etc.), signals, and networking. Yikai will work as the project manager; Sharon will focus on the processes and backend; and John will work on developing the GUI. We plan on using structs and lists to handle the storage of clients and songs. We plan on using an arraylist to handle saving the melodies, as well as a concurrent server algorithm to handle multiple users at once.
