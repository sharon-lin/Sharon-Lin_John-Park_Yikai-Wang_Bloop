Abstract: Our team is developing a GUI in which users will be able to operate and play a virtual piano.

Description of Use: Users will press keys on the keyboard that correspond to keys on the virtual piano, allowing them to play melodies. There will be a series of white and black keys corresponding to each of the keys on a standard piano. In addition, users will be able to save their melodies as files and upload melodies to be played.

Description of Design: We plan on using memory allocation, files (uploading), processes (forking, exec, etc.), signals, pipes (named), shared memory, semaphores, and networking. Yikai will work as the project manager; Sharon will focus on the processes, piping, and backend; and John will work on developing the GUI. We plan on using a linked list to store melodies, as well as a queue to handle the sound from the keyboard and the concurrent users. We plan on using an arraylist to handle saving the melodies, as well as a concurrent server algorithm to handle multiple users at once.
